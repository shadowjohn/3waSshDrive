# 3waSshDrive History

## 2026-09-18 — Project start

- Project name fixed as `3waSshDrive`.
- Chosen stack: C# .NET Framework 4.7.2 and WinForms.
- Runtime architecture: WinFsp .NET host callbacks directly backed by SSH.NET/SFTP.
- Explicitly rejected runtime wrappers around `cmd.exe`, `net use`, and `sshfs-win.exe`.
- Phase 1 target: source-compiled, key-authenticated, host-key-pinned, read-only drive mount.
- WinFsp native runtime/driver remains a required machine prerequisite.
- WinFsp v2.1 and SSH.NET 2026.0.0 are pinned as source submodules.
